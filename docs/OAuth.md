OAuth
    solution
        how to provide delegated_access to without putting end-user's data at risk
                                └─ allowing applications to talk to each other on behalf of end-user
    OAuth for user authentication
        point of view of this mind map
            developer of client
        resource owner
            owns protected resource
                hosted on resource server
                    owned by OAuth provider
            consents to delegated access to protected resource
                                    └─ by client
        protected resource
            owned by resource owner
            stored on OAuth provider's database
            accessed by client
                upon successful access delegation process
                    to use it in services that client provide to resource owner
        client
            of OAuth provider
            wants to
                access resource server

            used by
                resource server
                    as a means
                        to allow client to access protected resource

            terminologies
                user = end-user
                app = app that developer is building which uses OAuth to authenticate its users into the system.
                provider = OAuth provider
            1. user attempts to login to app
            2. app redirect user to validation API of provider
            3. provider validates user
            4. provider redirects user back to app with an access token
            5. app uses access token to access user's information which is hosted on provider's servers
            6. app creates session for the user
